This is a group project that was done in 2020 at KTH. 
A website was developed in order to search for the prerequisites of any given KTH course name or code.
The main inspiration of doing this project is that KTH requires its students 
to pass specific courses before they can finally become eligible to take a higher level course.
The website can be found at:    https://pegasuskth.github.io/index.html
Example input to test the features of the website: "SK1118"
